                        <p class="mb-lg-1-9">Tempered glass is a type of safety glass processed by controlled thermal or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass. Tempering puts the outer surfaces into compression and the interior into tension. Such stresses cause the glass, when broken, to shatter into small granular chunks instead of splintering into jagged shards as ordinary annealed glass does. The granular chunks are less likely to cause injury.</p>

                        <p class="mb-lg-1-9">A combination of two or more sheets of glass, separated by a spacer bar and sealed so that it forms a single unit, having one or more air spaces in between is called a Double-Glazed Unit. It is commonly referred to as 'double glazing glass' or 'double pane'. Double glazing or insulated glass evolved from the traditional double-hung windows and storm windows, which separated the interior and exterior spaces using a single pane of glass. The primary benefit of double glazing is thermal insulation – to retain heat in a room whilst stopping cold air entering from outside to make the room more energy-efficient.</p>

When we choose glass, in addition to paying attention to its price, we should also pay attention to the different properties of various types of glass, and choose the type that is more suitable for home use.</p>

                        <p class="mb-lg-1-9">People are now concerned more about the impact of products used in construction. Glass is completely recyclable and it is the most environment friendly material used in construction. Further, the cost of installing bent glass has greatly reduced. All these properties related to glass have led to the rising importance of glass in architecture. With the use of glass, natural light can be let inside the building and people in the building can also get connected with the outer landscape. A sense of space can be established strongly with the use of glass in structures.</p>
                        <p class="mb-lg-1-9">Just like light is transferred, glass has the tendency to let heat in. However, modern day technology uses different types of coating to insulate glasses used in buildings. This way, suitable amount of warmth is locked inside the building and it remains unaffected by the variation in temperature outside. The thermal insulation of bent glass is usually represented as K value.</p>
                        <p class="mb-lg-1-9">To enhance the corporate image and to make the building stand out of the rest, curved surfaces are used in modern buildings. Facades have become essential in corporate buildings and using bent glass, different types of facades can be built. For aesthetic reasons too, glass is widely used in commercial and residential buildings</p>

                        <h5>Glass Edge Polishing</h5>
                        <p class="mb-lg-1-9">This method involves cutting the edges of the glass and then flat polishing them, resulting in a sleek appearance and shiny or glossy finish. Most flat-polished applications also employ a small 45° angle chamfer on the top and bottom glass edges to remove sharpness and “chatter” which can also be polished</p>
                        <p class="mb-lg-1-9">Polished edges are produced by buffing the edge of the glass with a fine abrasive material and polishing oil. The result is a beautifully translucent finish. Flat polished edges are excellent options for the thicker glass used in shelves and frameless shower enclosures.</p>
